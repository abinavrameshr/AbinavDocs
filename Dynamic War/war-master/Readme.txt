Rules for Spades War:

 

1. A standard pack of 52 cards is used. 

2. The cards rank from highest to lowest: A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2.

3. This is 2 Player game.

4. Each player gets 26 cards, randomly shuffled.

5. Iteration is where both players lay out their cards and the value is compared. The card with the highest value wins.The Player having the highest card value wins the iteration.

6. Player1 can call a Value from 1 to 13, This is the number of cards taken for the Spades War iteration 1.

7. Lets say Player 1 calls a value of 4, 4 cards are to be drawn by both player1 and player2.

8. The 4 iterations are played i.e. Comparison of value of cards are done one by one. Example: If player one pulls a King of Hearts and Player 2 pulls a King of Spades. Player 2 wins because Spades are greater than hearts.So Player 1 wins this set and gets both the cards and keeps it away ( called as a hand).

9. After 4 Iterations the Player with the most hands wins the round.If it's a tie 3 cards from each side is added to the pot and the player with the highest values wins all 8 cards.

10. Similarly the player can call any number of iterations from 1 to 13.

11. Lets say Player 2 calls 5 now.

12. 5 cards are to be drawn by both players.

14. Now the same iterations concept continues.

15. At the end of all 26 cards being lost by any player to the other player .The player with most wins in rounds is declared the winner.

16. In case it it’s a Draw it shows that Match is Drawn! if not it shows Game Over ! 

17. Any player that loses all his cards is the loser.
